# sustainable-forest-management
Given the importance of forests to the planet, sustainable management is essential to ensure society’s demands don’t compromise the resource. Sustainable forest management offers a holistic approach to ensure forest activities deliver social, environmental and economic benefits, balance competing needs and maintain and enhance forest functions now and in the future. Forest certification is the tool to demonstrate this and to connect the consumer with the sustainable origins of their products.
